## 📥 Data Loading and Initial Exploration

### **Business Question:** *"What does our customer data look like?"*

```python
# Load dataset from Google Sheets
df = pd.read_csv('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS597_KVD9wqThs6lDsxukLZHE0eNbHvMQiJN66H2PhU_CRJRIBX_0wT4LLJL8vhYm3deHV-XMMoBj9/pub?gid=284931259&single=true&output=csv')

# Quick data overview
print("First 5 rows:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
print(df.info())
print("\nBasic Statistics:")
print(df.describe())
print("\nMissing Values:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

### **Key Findings:**
- **350 customers** in the dataset
- **Only 2 missing values** in Satisfaction Level (0.57% missing rate)
- **Well-balanced dataset** with good data quality

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### **Business Question:** *"How can we prepare the data for analysis?"*

#### Missing Value Strategy
We found 2 missing satisfaction values. **Strategy chosen:** Mode imputation
- **Why:** Only 0.57% missing, both records had similar profiles (Bronze members with low ratings)
- **Business Logic:** Mode imputation maintains class distribution without bias

```python
# Handle missing satisfaction levels
df_clean["Satisfaction Level"] = df_clean["Satisfaction Level"].fillna(df_clean["Satisfaction Level"].mode()[0])
```

#### Feature Engineering
**Why create new features?** To capture customer behavior patterns that aren't obvious in raw data.

```python
# 1. SPENDING EFFICIENCY: How much customers spend per item
df_clean['Spend Per Item'] = df_clean['Total Spend'] / (df_clean['Items Purchased'] + 1)
# Business Value: Identifies premium vs. discount shoppers

# 2. CUSTOMER VALUE FLAGS: Identify high-value customers
df_clean['High Spender'] = (df_clean['Total Spend'] > df_clean['Total Spend'].quantile(0.75)).astype(int)
df_clean['Frequent Buyer'] = (df_clean['Items Purchased'] > df_clean['Items Purchased'].quantile(0.75)).astype(int)
# Business Value: Target high-value customers for loyalty programs

# 3. RECENCY SEGMENTS: When did customers last purchase?
df_clean['Recency Category'] = pd.cut(df_clean['Days Since Last Purchase'],
                                      bins=[-1, 7, 30, 90, float('inf')],
                                      labels=['Very Recent', 'Recent', 'Moderate', 'Long Ago'])
# Business Value: Re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers

# 4. AGE DEMOGRAPHICS: Life stage targeting
df_clean['Age Group'] = pd.cut(df_clean['Age'],
                               bins=[0, 25, 35, 50, 100],
                               labels=['Young', 'Adult', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior'])
# Business Value: Age-appropriate marketing and product recommendations
```

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Business Question:** *"What patterns exist in our customer data?"*

Our comprehensive 9-chart dashboard reveals customer behavior patterns:

```python
def perform_eda(df):    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(20, 15))
    fig.suptitle('E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
    
    # 1. AGE DISTRIBUTION: Understanding our demographic
    axes[0,0].hist(df['Age'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='skyblue')
    # Business Insight: Shows primary age groups for targeted marketing
    
    # 2. SPENDING DISTRIBUTION: Revenue concentration
    axes[0,1].hist(df['Total Spend'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='lightgreen')
    # Business Insight: Identifies spending patterns and outliers
    
    # 3. GENDER SPLIT: Market composition
    gender_counts = df['Gender'].value_counts()
    axes[0,2].pie(gender_counts.values, labels=gender_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', 
                  colors=['lightpink', 'lightblue'])
    # Business Insight: Gender-based product and marketing strategies
    
    # 4. MEMBERSHIP TIERS: Premium vs. standard customers
    membership_counts = df['Membership Type'].value_counts()
    axes[1,0].bar(membership_counts.index, membership_counts.values, color='coral')
    # Business Insight: Membership program effectiveness
    
    # 5. SATISFACTION LEVELS: Customer happiness metrics
    satisfaction_counts = df['Satisfaction Level'].value_counts()
    axes[1,1].bar(satisfaction_counts.index, satisfaction_counts.values, color='gold')
    # Business Insight: Overall customer experience health
    
    # 6. SPEND vs ITEMS: Purchase behavior relationship
    axes[1,2].scatter(df['Items Purchased'], df['Total Spend'], alpha=0.6, color='purple')
    # Business Insight: Identifies bulk buyers vs. premium shoppers
    
    # 7. RATING DISTRIBUTION: Product/service quality perception
    axes[2,0].hist(df['Average Rating'], bins=15, alpha=0.7, color='orange')
    # Business Insight: Overall satisfaction with products/services
    
    # 8. PURCHASE RECENCY: Customer engagement levels
    axes[2,1].hist(df['Days Since Last Purchase'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='pink')
    # Business Insight: Customer retention and re-engagement needs
    
    # 9. GENDER SPENDING PATTERNS: Demographic spending differences
    bp = axes[2,2].boxplot([df[df['Gender']=='Male']['Total Spend'], 
                           df[df['Gender']=='Female']['Total Spend']], 
                          labels=['Male', 'Female'], patch_artist=True, widths=0.6)
    bp['boxes'][0].set_facecolor('lightblue')
    bp['boxes'][1].set_facecolor('lightpink')
    axes[2,2].set_title('Total Spend by Gender')
    axes[2,2].grid(False)
    # Business Insight: Gender-based spending behavior for targeted campaigns
```

### **Key EDA Insights:**
- **Average Customer:** 33.6 years old, spends $845.38, buys 12.6 items
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Majority satisfied, but opportunities exist
- **Gender Patterns:** Spending differences reveal marketing opportunities

## 🎯 Customer Segmentation

### **Business Question:** *"How should we group our customers for targeted strategies?"*

**Method Used:** K-Means Clustering with RFM-inspired features
**Features:** Age, Total Spend, Items Purchased, Average Rating, Purchase Recency

#### Why These Features?
- **Age:** Life stage targeting
- **Total Spend:** Revenue potential
- **Items Purchased:** Purchase frequency
- **Average Rating:** Satisfaction proxy
- **Days Since Last Purchase:** Engagement level

```python
def customer_segmentation(df):
    # Feature selection for clustering
    features_for_clustering = ['Age', 'Total Spend', 'Items Purchased', 
                              'Average Rating', 'Days Since Last Purchase']
    
    # Standardization (crucial for K-means)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_cluster_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[features_for_clustering])
    
    # Optimal cluster selection using elbow method
    # Tests k=2 through k=10 to find the best number of segments
    
    # Apply K-means with optimal k=4
    optimal_k = 4
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    df['Customer_Segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_cluster_scaled)
```

### **Customer Segments Identified:**

| Segment | Profile | Business Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **0** | Budget Conscious | Value-focused offers |
| **1** | Premium Customers | Exclusive experiences |
| **2** | Average Shoppers | Loyalty programs |
| **3** | Potential Churners | Re-engagement campaigns |

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling

### **Business Questions:** 
- *"Can we predict customer satisfaction?"*
- *"What drives customer spending?"*

#### Model 1: Customer Satisfaction Prediction
**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
**Purpose:** Identify at-risk customers before they become unsatisfied

```python
# Features that influence satisfaction
features_satisfaction = ['Age', 'Gender_Encoded', 'City_Encoded', 'Membership_Encoded',
                        'Total Spend', 'Items Purchased', 'Average Rating', 
                        'Discount Applied', 'Days Since Last Purchase']

# Train Random Forest model
rf_satisfaction = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_satisfaction.fit(X_train_sat_scaled, y_train_sat)
```

**Model Performance:**
- **Accuracy:** ~85-90% (varies by data split)
- **Business Value:** Early warning system for customer dissatisfaction

#### Model 2: Total Spend Prediction
**Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
**Purpose:** Forecast customer lifetime value and personalize offers

```python
# Features that drive spending
features_spend = ['Age', 'Gender_Encoded', 'City_Encoded', 'Membership_Encoded',
                 'Items Purchased', 'Average Rating', 'Discount Applied', 
                 'Days Since Last Purchase']

# Train Random Forest model
rf_spend = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_spend.fit(X_train_spend_scaled, y_train_spend)
```

**Model Performance:**
- **R² Score:** Explains variance in customer spending
